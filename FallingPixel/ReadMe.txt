IT LOOKS BETER IF YOU TURN THE CONTRAST UP (2nd up arrow to increase contrast) (2nd down arrow to decrease contrast) 

About:
The objective is to get from one end of the screen to the other without colliding with any pixels.

You have two lives...
life 1: slow moving 3x3 block
life 2: fast moving 1x1 pixel

10 pixels are added at the start of every level

Your score is equal to the total number of rows your pixel descended.

Hold the calculator sideways.

Bugs:

if you press the left or right arrow while the pixel is flashing after losing your first life, the pixel will go that direction for one frame.
